        <p class="w3-large">Algae refer to thousands of photosynthetic organisms, from unicellular microalgae to seaweed. These organisms are in large part responsible for the oxygen in our atmosphere. We eat some varieties, but there is great potential in the expansion of their cultivation. Some varieties could be used to treat waste and create fertilizer, and there is ongoing research into their use in the production of biofuel.
            <br><br>Algae Globe is an interactive sculpture and functional bioreactor that allows people to experience the symbiotic relationship between humans and microalgae. As visitors blow into the funnels, lights and bubbles are triggered, allowing people to feed the algae with lights and the carbon dioxide they exhale.

       <!--  <h4>say something</h4> -->
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Sewage, or sludge, has the potential to be transformed into useful byproducts. Channeling Waste is an interactive sculpture that demonstrates how every flush can be turned into electrical power, fuel for transportation, or fertilizer for agriculture. The technology for biodigesters is being applied at different scales around the world, creating a circular system to create value out of what was previously a big problem.
            <br><br>Visitors flush toilet handles on a large waste barrels that trigger projected animations and sound. The unexpected outcomes of electricity, biofuel, and fertilizer contrast with the expectations of biological waste, instead showing the potential alternatives.

        <p class="w3-large">Enough solar energy reaches the earth everyday to power all of human civilization. Solar Silk is a light installation that hovers above the exhibition space, celebrating solar energy, one of the most prevalent and promising alternative energy resources.
            <br><br>Solar Silk visualizes real time UV index data that indicates the amount of potential solar energy at Fort Mason in San Francisco, where the piece is installed, in real time. The colors lighting the fabric can be mapped to the UV index on the floor. The changing colors and patterns of the light reflect the availability of solar energy to be harvested. Through long term observation, visitors can perceive changes in available energy.

        <h5 class="w3-center">Carbon Farming</h5><br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">Soil is a major element in earthâ€™s carbon cycles. As plants absorb carbon from the air and trade it with microbes and fungi in the soil, carbon is effectively sequestered. Farming techniques like Regenerative Agriculture, Permaculture, and Carbon Farming all describe methods of farming that reinforce these natural cycles, and can undo some of the damage already done by industrial farming practices.
            <br><br>Carbon Farming is a video and soil sculpture that shows how regenerative agriculture and carbon farming build healthy soil, reduce the need for petroleum-based fertilizers, and fight global warming. Visitors can watch videos from <a href="https://kisstheground.com/" title="Kiss The Ground Homepage" class="w3-hover-text-green">Kiss the Ground</a> and <a href="https://www.4p1000.org/" title="4 per 1000 Homepage" class="w3-hover-text-green">4 per 1000</a> through peepholes on fruit crates, which graphically represent conventional agriculture. A six-foot tall soil sculpture show how plants sequester carbon naturally.
