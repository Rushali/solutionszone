        <p class="w3-left">The Solution Space was conceived as a new collaboration within the Coal and Ice documentary photography exhibit. The space includes the work of six young artists all affiliated with the Interactive Telecommunications Program at Tisch-NYU either as Research Residents or students. The goal was to contrast the dark, immersive, consequence-oriented space of Coal and Ice with a bright, optimistic, and reflective space to learn about ongoing efforts to halt and reverse    climate change.
        <br><br>Visitors are invited to explore the existing possibilities of transforming the human behaviour that has led to ecological crisis. Exhibits offer different levels of interactivity, communicating the importance and potential of different techniques, technologies, and innovations. Visitors actively participate in connecting the dots and building knowledge, which hopefully will extend beyond their exit of the space.

       <!--  <h4>say something</h4> -->
        <p class="w3-text-grey">The designers of the space researched the most promising proposals to combat climate change, talking to policy experts, scientists, and leaders from the non-profit and public sectors. The top priority became communicating the massive efforts at all levels of society that should give us reason to be hopeful about the future. Some of the potential solutions and proposals were important but dry, while others were exciting but improbable. The challenge was the balance this, while also developing a dynamic, active exhibit with compelling information without being overly didactic.
          <br><br>The individual exhibits demonstrate one general approach, technology, or technique both at high levels and at granular levels. Through interaction and exploration, visitors discover these ideas. The dots and banners allow each visitor to develop their own pathway and links through the space.
          <br><br>The interactive exhibits were designed by the team, but donations from SolarReserve and the San Francisco Parks department highlighted the importance or Energy Storage technology and Environmental Stewardship, respectively, in a more passive way. The team also curated video content from non-profits and organizations promoting circular economies, environmental justice, and electrification.
