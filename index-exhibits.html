        <p class="w3-large">Far out on the horizon--but so interesting--is Algae. Another renewable resource that can be transformed into biofuel, fertilizer, and has the possibility of capturing carbon from the atmosphere. As a living organism it holds a symbiotic relationship with us which can be experienced through the interaction of this exhibit. Algae is important not only as of itself. California has invested in research on how to turn it into biofuel. But as a way of thinking. Our scientific knowledge allows us to transform not only the bi-products of our activities, but those of the interactions that we have with other organisms on planet earth. This same paradigm is portrayed in the Regenerative Agriculture and Soil Carbon exhibits

      <h5 class="w3-center">Channeling Waste</h5><br>
      <p class="w3-large">Waste is not a noun as much as a framework. The bi-products of any activity can be reintegrated into the value chained or transformed into new products. This exhibits aims to show how the residues that we produce through every flush can be turned into fuel for transportation, power and fertilizers for Agriculture. We currently dispose more of it than we can dispose use. Plastic, food, industrial residues shouldn't be wasted but taken advantage of.

        <h5 class="w3-center">Solar Silk</h5>
        <p class="w3-large">A light installation that hovers above the section about Renewable Energies celebrating solar energy, one of the most prevalent and promising alternative energy resources. Solar Silk visualizes real time UV index data that indicates the amount of potential solar energy at Fort Mason in San Francisco where the piece is installed. The changing colors and patterns of the light reflect the availability of solar energy to be harvested. Even though it delivers instant information, it is through long time observation that visitors can perceive the change of energy available and understand the scale to which solar energy can generate an impact in our lives. This exhibit lies at the core of the space as it portrays one of the biggest and most recent technology shifts. Renewable energy has the possibility of shifting several polluting human activities. The best example in California is transportation both massive and individual. With thousands of electrical buses serving the california cities and the wider availability of electrical cars the need of a sustainable source to power them can mark a large dent in the pollution produced by fuels for transportation. Two iPads underneath the canopy provide further information on this subject.

        <h4>and Soil Carbon</h4>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">There are two major ways we can reduce carbon emissions: renewable energies is one. Carbon Capture is the other. The soil plinth shows how soil draws down carbon and stores it deep in the earth. The exhibit in the fruit crates shows through short videos how if we change (or revert back to traditional) farming methods we can regenerate the soil and not release carbon in the air.</p><br>

    <!-- Molten Salt-->

      <div class="w3-col l6 w3-padding-large">
        <h5 class="w3-center">Molten Salt</h5><br>
        <p class="w3-text-grey">One of the biggest challenges with renewable energies is how to store the power they generate.
One example we show here is Molten Salt. The model was contributed by SolarReserve.
Here the molten salt is essentially an enormous battery that can store solar energy. The model does not demonstrate this as it is static, for this reason an ipad with an animated video on the matter is placed besides the exhibit.
This exhibit also dialogs with Jamey Stillings murals which cover the whole space. Some of these murals are aerial views of Crescent Dunes, the solar project in Nevada. This project produced 42,029 Megawattshours in 2017, the average household in EEUU consumed 10,766 kilowatthours in 2016.

          Around certain exhibits there are kiosks that showcase multimedia related to subjects like: Electric Vehicle transportation, Circular Economy and the work of The San Francisco Parks department which provided the greenery for the space.
